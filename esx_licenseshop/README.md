2) Add `start esx_licenseshop` to your server.cfg
3) Edit the `config.lua` to your liking

# Known Bugs:
* If a new player gets their DMV License you will have to restart the License Shop or have the Player Re-Log. This can be fixed easily by adding a Resource Restarter to the esx_dmvschool when a player passes their Test. (This will not be added as this is a messy way of handling it.)
